# Insurance

1. We got the quotation for the first CNCF Insurance proposal but the covergae of the Insurance was to high (1 million of USD), and of course the Insurance premium in LATAM for that coverage is high too, around $13,000 USD.

2. After conversations with Audra we got the number of 1 million of colones for the Insurance coverage, but a million of colones is just $2000 USD, to low now.

3. We met with Cristher where she recommended to get the Insurance with a coverage of $200,000 USD as it was in Colombia.

4. We got a liability insurance quotation with coverage of $200,000 USD, this is available here [Insurance Quote](https://github.com/cloudnativecostarica/kcd-planning-2025/blob/main/INSSJ-10275-2024.pdf).

The Insurance premiun is for an amount of: $2450.47 USD

5. We need to talk to Audra to explore the possibility of getting funding from the CNCF to cover this insurance premium.
